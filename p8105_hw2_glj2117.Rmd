## Problem 1

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).

```{r}
transit_data = 
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
 mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

```
Write a short paragraph about this dataset â€“ explain briefly what variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?


Answer the following questions using these data:

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway; 125st Lenox); the distinct function may be useful here.
How many stations are ADA compliant?
What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

As it stands, these data are not "tidy": route number should be a variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when considering questions that focus on station-level variables. 

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses `distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

```{r}
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of rows is the number of ADA compliant stations. 

```{r}
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable -- this logical, so taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

```{r}
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert `route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes with the required stations in rows).

```{r}
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```


## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
use reasonable variable names
omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

```{r}
mr_trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N534") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls)) 

```
Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel, and combine this with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to both datasets before combining.

```{r}
prof_trash_wheel = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N117") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls)) %>% 
  mutate(dataset = "prof")
 
mr_trash_wheel = mr_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(dataset = "mr")
 

trash_data = 
  full_join(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel) %>% 
  arrange(dumpster)
   
```
Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R. Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020?

The joined dataset includes `r nrow(trash_data)` observations on 453 dumpsters and associated key variables, such as date of observation, weight and volume of trash, and amount of plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery bags, chip bags, and sports balls in the trash. The `dataset` variable denotes if the data was collected by Mr. Trash Wheel (mr) or Professor Trash Wheel (prof).The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r trash_data %>% filter(dataset == "prof") %>% pull(weight_tons) %>% sum()`. Additionally, the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 was `r mr_trash_wheel %>% filter(year == 2020) %>% pull(sports_balls) %>% sum()`. 

```
##Problem 3

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

```{r}

pols_month = read_csv("pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(col = 'mon', into = c('year', 'month', 'day'), sep = '-') %>% 
   mutate(month = recode(month, "01" = "January", "02" = "February", "03" = "March", "04" = "April", "05" = "May", "06" = "June", "07" = "July", "08" = "August", "09" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) %>% 
   mutate(day = NULL) %>%
   mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
   mutate(prez_gop = NULL, prez_dem = NULL)
   

```
